Alright, here's a step-by-step guide for you:

    Fork the Repository:
        Go to the original repository on GitHub.
        Click on the "Fork" button in the top right corner.
        This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

    Clone Your Fork:
        Clone your fork to your local machine:

        bash

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/original-repo.git
    cd original-repo

Create a New Branch:

    Create a new branch for your changes:

    bash

    git checkout -b fix-run-script

Make and Commit Changes:

    Make your changes to run.sh.
    Add and commit the changes:

    bash

    git add run.sh
    git commit -m "Fix docker-compose command in run.sh"

Push Changes to Your Fork:

    Push the changes to your fork on GitHub:

    bash

    git push origin fix-run-script

Create a Pull Request:

    Go to your fork on GitHub.
    You should see a prompt to create a pull request from the branch you just pushed.
    Create the pull request, describing your changes.

Keep Your Fork Updated (Optional):

    If there are changes in the original repository while you are working, you can keep your fork updated:

    bash

        git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/original-repo.git
        git fetch upstream
        git checkout main
        git merge upstream/main
        git push origin main

Remember, this is just one way to do it. There are multiple workflows, but this should get you started!
